### Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis and modeling of the IRIS dataset using various machine learning techniques. The steps include data understanding, visualization, model training, evaluation, and improvement.

### Steps Completed

#### 1. Data Understanding and Exploration
- Generated basic statistical summaries of the IRIS dataset.
- Visualized the dataset using boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots.

#### 2. Splitting the Data into Training and Test Sets
- Split the dataset into training and test sets using `train_test_split`.
- Trained a Logistic Regression model and calculated its accuracy.

#### 3. Cross-Validation (K-Fold)
- Evaluated the model's performance more reliably using K-Fold Cross-Validation.

#### 4. Stratified Splitting
- Used Stratified K-Fold to split the dataset while preserving class distribution and compared model performance.

#### 5. Evaluating the Model with Different Metrics
