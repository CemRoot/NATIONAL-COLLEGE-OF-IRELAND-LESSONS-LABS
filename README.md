# NCI Master's Program - Lessons and Labs Repository

Welcome to the official repository for my Master's studies at **National College of Ireland (NCI), Dublin**. This repository is designed to organize and showcase various lessons and lab exercises conducted during the course.

## Overview

This repository contains two major sections:
- **Lectures**: Notes, slides, and other resources from weekly classes.
- **Labs**: Hands-on lab exercises that correspond with each week's lecture topics.

### üìÇ **Lectures Folder**
The **Lectures** folder contains materials from the lectures, including slides, reading notes, and example codes. The lecture notes are meant to supplement the learning experience and reinforce theoretical knowledge discussed during the sessions.

### üß™ **Labs Folder**
The **Labs** folder includes practical exercises and coding assignments. Each lab corresponds to a different topic covered in class, such as:
- Python programming
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Cloud computing
- Machine learning fundamentals

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**
The lab materials are constantly updated as part of my coursework. To access the latest versions of the documents and see live updates, the lab documents have been moved to **OneDrive** for easier version control. This ensures that all lab content is regularly synchronized with my ongoing work.

You can access the most up-to-date lab documents via the links below:
